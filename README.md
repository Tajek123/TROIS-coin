# TROIS-coin
The republic of innes slovenia coin. It was made from bitcoin blockchain as source code and modifyed to work on newer ubuntu server version

Made by a 14 year old (literly) Taj Pocrnja Zupan, published on the 28th of november 2025 in Slovenia. 

Trois coin is a crypto currency ran by an old ASUS laptop. It was made with forking the Bitcoin src. code on Ubuntu server.

firstly I had to clone the bitcoin repository from github and rewind the version back to V22 so old hardware wouldn't cause any problems. After that, I had to change the code strings that "brand" Bitcoin, my own (Bitcoin -> TROIS coin, BTC -> ISC and Satoshi ->  TROIS). Ater that The ports Bitcoin uses. They were located in the chainparams.cpp file. Bitcoin uses 8333 to connect to other nodes, port 8332 for RPC which is mostly used in commands and port 18333 used by Bitcoin Testnet. I changed Mainnet Listening port (8333) to 9333, Testnet listening port (18333) to 19333 and JSON-RPC Port (8332) to 9332. After that I had to change pchMessageStart (0-3) codes to my own. Theese are essentially codes computers use to connect to the node. I changed first one to 0xfa, second one to 0xce, third one to 0xb0 and fourth one to 0x0c. I kept  consensus.nSubsidyHalvingInterval at same value as bitcoin which was 210000. It tells you after how many blocks mined does reward get cut in half. After that I had to "mine" my own first genisis block. I did that with a simple python program to calculate the nounce and left everything else same. After that I executed autogen.sh file, which makes a configuration script I firstly ran without wallet GUI and without tests, buit that failed duo to conflict between new ubuntu server and bitcoin node, whichworks only with Berkeley DB 4.8 to create wallet.dat file. but version I used didn't have Berkeley DB 4.8, but it had Berkeley DB 5.3. and then I ran make command to convert C++ code into bianary. after that finished, I created a config file and rpcpassword, rpcuser... after that I started the deamon and it worked but there was zero blocks mined currently. after that I installed Berkeley DB 4.8 which allowed me to clean last make and redo the process (make). after that finished I ran command (./src/bitcoin-cli -conf=/home/youruser/.mycoin/mycoin.conf generatetoaddress 1 "[ADDRESS]") to start mining first block buit it didn't work, duo to limit that was set to 2 million which would only allow computer to calculate 2 million times. So I added an attribute to the end to increate the limit to 999999999. 

And that was how first TROIS block was mined.
